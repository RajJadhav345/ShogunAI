## ShogunAI Notebook Instructions:

### 1. **Setting Up in Google Colab**:
   - Open the **ShogunAI.ipynb** file in Google Colab.
   - Upload the **Data** folder as it is into the Colab environment.

### 2. **Running the Initial Cells**:
   - **Run the first 3 cells** in the notebook every time you start working. These cells are essential for initializing the model and setting up the environment.

### 3. **Running Specific Cells**:

   - **For a Detailed Conversation Layout**: 
        Run **Cell 3**. This will display how the conversation flow will be structured.

   - **For Instructions on How to Reply to a Text**: 
        Run **Cell 4**. This will provide guidelines for generating appropriate responses.

### Note:
Ensure that the **Data** folder contains the embedded data and is uploaded correctly before running the notebook. The notebook and associated scripts rely on the proper data format for effective execution.
